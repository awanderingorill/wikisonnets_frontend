	p Wikisonnet was created by Ana Giraldo-Wingler, Cassie Tarakajian, and Sam Tarakajian. To generate these sonnets, we have scanned all of Wikipedia, and found every single line that a contributor has written that is in iambic pentameter. We then have written an algorithm to create sonnets given a starting Wikipedia article. You can check out the source code
